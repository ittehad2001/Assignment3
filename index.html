    <h3>Learning Websites</h3>
    <h4><u>W3schools</u></h4>
    <p> W3Schools is a freemium educational website for learning coding online.[1][2] Initially released in 1998, it derives its name from the World Wide Web but is not affiliated with the W3 Consortium.[3][4] W3Schools
        offers courses covering all aspects of web development.[5]W3Schools also publishes free HTML templates. It is run by Refsnes Data in Norway.[6]It has an online text editor called Trylt Editor, and readers can edit
        examples and run the code in a test environment.</p>
    <h4><u>Mozilla Developers</u></h4>
    <p style="" >

        MDN Web Docs,previously Mozilla Developer Network and formerly Mozilla Developer Center, is a documentation repository and learning resource for web developers. It was started by Mozilla in 2005[1] as a unified
        place for documentation about open web standards, Mozilla's own projects, and developer guides.[2] MDN Web Docs content is mamtained by Mozilla, Google employees, and volunteers (community of developers and
        technical wtriters). It also contams content contributed by Microsoft Google, and Samsung who, in 2017, announced they would shut down their ouwn documentation projects and move all their documentation to MDN
        Web Docs.[3]Topics include HTML5, JavaScript, CSS, Web APIs, Django, Node.js, WebExtensionss MathML, and Others[4]</p>

        <h3>Write short note:</h3>
        
            <p>1.HTTP and HTTPS,and its funcation</p>
            <p><h4>Both HTTP and HTTPS help web users transfer and receive information over the Internet. So, what is the difference between HTTP and HTTPS?

                HTTPS with its secure information transfer, however, is particularly important for sites where sensitive information is sent, such as ecommerce sites where users submit payment information like billing addresses, phone numbers and credit card data. HTTPS works with the protocol known as Transport Layer Security (TLS), or previously Secure Sockets Layer (SSL), to encrypt sensitive data, prevent the alteration or corruption of data during transfer, and authenticate certain users to communicate with the website.
                
                Essentially, HTTPS provides security by generating short-term session keys, or encryption codes, for the data transfers between a user and the website server. These security keys must be certified by a certificate authority such as Comodo or Symantec.
                
                The original use for HTTPS was for ecommerce transactions, email, and other sensitive data transfers. Today it has become the standard for all websites, endorsed by Google itself and now a requirement for many advanced features like progressive web applications.</h4></p>
           <p>2.Google Search is an unavoidable part for programmers life.</p>
           <p><h4>Google Search has become an indispensable tool in the life of programmers. With its vast 
            database of information and lightning-fast search capabilities, it serves as an invaluable 
            resource for finding solutions to coding problems, discovering documentation, and exploring 
            new technologies. Programmers frequently turn to Google to seek guidance on error messages,
             learn new programming languages, and access tutorials and examples. From debugging complex 
             issues to understanding unfamiliar concepts, Google Search offers a lifeline that accelerates 
             productivity and fosters continuous learning. Its ubiquity in the programming community highlights
              its significance as an indispensable companion, 
            empowering programmers to overcome challenges and push the boundaries of their craft.</h4></p>
